Put anything else you want us to know here.

Problem 1 took a bit to get used to which functions required which types, but overall wasn't hard. The hardest part was that Docker doesn't work, so all my code testing was on https://replit.com/languages/haskell first. The second question went quickly code-wise, but it took a long time to get it debugged so that tux wouldn't throw errors. Once I figured out the data structure of the third problem, it wasn't too hard. The recursion threw me for a loop for a while though.
